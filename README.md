**Internship Contribution**

The project titled 'Product Data Extraction Example' was completed during my internship at a startup company called Yamzing. I created a readable table based on customer information and order details extracted from the company's database. Python was utilized as the programming language, employing Pandas data frames to generate the table. Additionally, I translated the table into Chinese.
